# SourceConExtras
This is a mix of code and explanations to complement my series of posts for SourceCon.com leading up to the
SourceCon Austin conference in Sept. 2017.

If you have access to the SourceConProgrammers repository, I am generally following the material they are covering, but also throwing in some extras of my own.

It's easiest if you start by reading the PowerPoint file in this repo first, and then read the aforementioned SC posts at https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Asourcecon.com+gutmacher+(%22how+to+learn%22+OR+%22sourcecon+partners+with%22)&rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS963US963&newwindow=1

P.S. You may find this earlier step-by-step presentation I did at SourceCon Denver in Oct. 2014 which was prequel to the all-day 2017 event: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXuOfmqye_Q&list=PLh9V7buk0vuDxX9G_acEyuZ4VVMa7b51v

To add a blank space in a README.md file, you can use HTML markup or Markdown syntax. Here are a few ways to achieve this:

1. Using HTML:
Insert the following HTML code to create a blank space:
<br/>

2. Using Markdown:
Markdown syntax provides a way to insert a blank line between two lines of text. You can simply add an empty line to create a blank space:

Line 1

Line 2

Alternatively, you can use two or more empty spaces at the end of a line to force a line break:
Line 1  
Line 2

3. Using HTML comments

Another approach is to use HTML comments to create a blank space. This method is useful if you want to add a larger empty space. Here's an example:

<!--

This is a blank space.
You can add multiple empty lines or text here.
